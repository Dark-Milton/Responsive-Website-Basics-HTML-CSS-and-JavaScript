Web Application Technologies and Django By University of Michigan


# About this Course

In this course, you'll explore the basic structure of a web application, and how a web browser interacts with a web server. You'll be introduced to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) request/response cycle, including GET/POST/Redirect. You'll also gain an introductory understanding of Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), as well as the overall structure of a Django application.  We will explore the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for web applications and how it relates to Django.  You will learn how to deploy a Django application using a service like PythonAnywhere so that it is available over the Internet. 

This is the first course in the Django for Everybody specialization. It is recommended that you complete the Python for Everybody specialization or an equivalent learning experience before beginning this series.
